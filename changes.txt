changes:
- (done) dark mode context menu
- (done) removed swallowing of inputs when not focused
- (done) changed cursor back to the old invert (conhostold.exe) since there were graphical glitches. if the backcolor is gray the cursor is impossible/hard to see -> find a better solution
- (done) only redraw the main buffer scrollbar on update

investigate:
- scrollbar updates twice per window resize, once for the window resize and once for the buffer resize
- change the cursor invert so it is always visible without graphical glitches

bugs:
- (fixed) scrollbar does not update when maximized / in fullscreen
- scrollbar flickers with a very old graphic sometimes
- scrollbar does not always hide thumb when disabled

features:
- (done) disabled telemetry
- remove telemetry comepletely
- sixel support
- disabling of scrollbars with a setting
